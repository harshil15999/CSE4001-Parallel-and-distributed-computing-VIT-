# CSE4001-Parallel-and-distributed-computing

### Introduction to Open MP
* OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) for parallel programming
* It supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing
* Supports HPC since 1997 (Latest 2013 â€“ version 4)
* Governed by OpenMP Architecture Review Board (ARB)

### Advantages

* Standardization and Portability
* Ease of use
* Thread based
* Fork-join model: **https://ipcc.cs.uoregon.edu/lectures/lecture-9-fork-join.pdf**
    * _side note_ -With K-way fork-join and N levels of fork-join,can have up to KN-way parallelism 
* Directive based approach :A large class of applications can be efficiently supported by higher level constructs (or directives) which **rid the programmer of the mechanics of manipulating low level threads.**
